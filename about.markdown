I'm Robert Kirk, a software engineer at [Smarkets](https://smarkets.com) and an [effective altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

I graduated from the University of Oxford in 2018 with an integrated masters in mathematics and computer science. I'm interested in AI and AI safety, and how can I use my career to have a positive impact on society. I think the threat of existential risk from AI is real, and think studying that problem is one of the best ways (and the way I'm currently pursuing) to have a positive impact on the future of humanity.

This blog is a place where I'll share my thoughts on AI and AI safety, as well as possibly stuff to do with effective altruism or rationality. In terms of AI, I'm most interested in deep reinforcement learning, meta-learning and deep learning interpretability.
