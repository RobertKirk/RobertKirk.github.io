I'm Robert Kirk, a PhD Student at [UCL DARK Lab](https://ucl-dark.github.io/) in the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence - UCL – University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) supervised by [Tim Rocktäschel](https://rockt.github.io/). I'm an aspiring <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruist</a> and rationalist. I'm interested in reinforcement learning, meta learning, natural language processing, interpretability and deep learning (and all the combinations thereof).

Before that, worked for <a href="https://smarkets.com/careers/">Smarkets</a>, a sports and politics betting exchange, as an infrastructure and software engineer. I worked there since August 2018. For the first year and a half I worked as a software engineering in a team developing python micro-services, and then I moved to join the infrastructure team.

Before that I studied for four years at [Somerville college](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, for an integrated masters in mathematics and computer science. Up until the fourth year I maintained a 50/50 split between the two subjects, and in the fourth year I focused more on abstract computer science. I did my [masters thesis](https://github.com/RobertKirk/Graph-Comonads-from-Pebble-Games) on implementing the comonadic formulation of pebble games in [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) supervised by [Samson Abramsky](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samson.abramsky/).

I write for the [Alignment Newsletter](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/), mostly on the topic of interpretability. Originally formed as part of [AI Safety Research Program](https://aisrp.org/), I'm collaborating with a small group of fellow independent researchers on interpretability, both doing technical research and thinking about how interpretability helps AI alignment.

Other than technical things, I'm interested in rationality, neuroscience, cooking, videogames, music (basically any genre), and reading. I sing in a choir and previously played the French horn.

This site is a place where I'll share my thoughts on all of these topics and possibly more, but the content will mostly be technical AI and AI safety related.
